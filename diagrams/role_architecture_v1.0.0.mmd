    %% Notes
    note for Architect "Decomposes tasks; defines structure; proposes system-level plans"
    note for Coder "Generates implementation details, schemas, and executable code"
    note for Reasoner "Explores edge cases and validates logic"
    note for Synthesizer "Merges outputs into final coherent result"
