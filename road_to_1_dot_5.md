# Road to v1.5: The Autonomous Intelligence Era

## Objective
Transition from a high-fidelity hardware orchestration layer to a fully autonomous, 7D Agile-driven multi-agent cluster.

## Phase 7: Unified Cluster Memory (The Bridge)
- [ ] **Relay Storage Authority**: Canonical persistence moved to the HTPC Relay server over ZFS.
- [ ] **Networked SQL**: Move from local `commander_memory.db` to a centralized service accessible by all nodes.
- [ ] **Agent Sync**: Agents on Laptop/Steam-Deck must report telemetry and logs through the Relay to ensure GUI visibility.

## Phase 8: Native Agent Mobilization
- [ ] **The Commander Meta-Agent**: Implement the core logic in `commander_os/agents/commander/` to enforce 7D Agile protocols.
- [ ] **Recruiter Agent Implementation**: Build the first production-grade sub-agent following the recruitment pipeline spec.
- [ ] **Autonomous Loop**: Implement the `DEFINE -> DESIGN -> DEVELOP -> DEBUG` cycle as a code-controlled handoff between agents.

## Phase 9: Tool Empowerment (MCP Integration)
- [ ] **Model Context Protocol**: Standardize how agents interact with the local filesystem and terminal.
- [ ] **Safety Air-Gap**: Implement Commander-controlled toggles for "Internet Access" (Job Scrapers/Email).

## Phase 10: Scalability & Synthesis (v1.5)
- [ ] **Horizontal Expansion**: Optimized load balancing for 8+ nodes.
- [ ] **Advanced Synthesis**: High-fidelity project aggregation and visual mission reporting.
